## College
Buying the snake oil is pretty stupid. You stand there and listen to the dim-witted pitch: "This here snake oil will cure cancer! Raise the dead! Keep away Ebola! Ward off Alzheimer's! Put a spring in your step and in your schlong!" Every claim makes you more and more sure this here snake oil is the cure for what ails you.

The salesman finishes his pitch. "Yes-sirree, if you buy this, you got a bright future ahead of you—good, high-payin job, interestin work, nice comfy retirement. After all, the market knows the value of a snake oil-user. They know they're gettin the best with you. But all that's pretty much gone if you don't buy this here snake oil—you're gonna be cleanin gum off the sidewalk the rest of your life." You hate cleaning gum off the sidewalk. No matter what, you have to have the snake oil.

You ask the salesman how much, and he won't tell you. Instead he asks you how much you got. You tell him, and he says "Well, boy shucks howdy, that ain't never gonna be enough to afford this here snake oil. But if you're serious, I could let you buy it on credit."

You have to have the snake oil, so you agree. You ask the salesman what the terms for the credit are. "I can't tell ya now," he says. "But you'll know it when ya need it."

You take the snake oil every day, but nothing seems to change. You still get sick. You still end up cleaning gum off the sidewalk. You hear of other people taking the snake oil who have amazing things happen to them. They get nice, high-paying jobs, interesting work, and a nice comfy retirement. But not you. You can't figure out what's different.

Long after the snake oil is gone, the salesman comes around for his repayment. He presents a bill for several hundred times your yearly wages at your gum-scraping job, payable now. You can't pay it, so he takes everything you have, gets your employer to pay everything you make directly to him, and charges you more money for every day you don't pay him back the full amount. Then he makes you thank him for it.

"I taught you valuable life lessons," he says. "I taught you to be an adult and own up to your mistakes."

Buying that snake oil was pretty stupid. Buying it on credit was even stupider.
## Success
Some people I know say "I look at those rich people who've never had to suffer, and I see their success, and I don't wish I had it. Even if I'm not successful, I'm glad I suffered. It made me a better person. It made me who I am today." But it seems to me that society doesn't care. Society values people who achieve the same thing as everyone else in the same way as everyone else.

Sometimes someone achieves the same thing as everyone else in a slightly different way. Then they get lauded as a maverick genius who went against the common wisdom. But the important thing is that the end result is the same. People who do things a different way and achieve a different outcome aren't lauded or praised. They're usually ignored or reviled or mocked.

Society doesn't reward for failure. No matter how instructive it was. No matter how much better a person you are because of your suffering, if you didn't hit the markers, you failed. Maybe in some abstract sense you've been rewarded, but if your aim was to get some tangible reward, you won't. It doesn't matter how big your obstacles were or what kind of suffering you went through. If you suffered and achieved what everyone else does, sometimes society will notice. Sometimes it will pat you on the back. But only if you hit the right checkpoints. Otherwise you're just a failure.

I am a failure. I wanted to achieve something tangible, but because of my suffering, I didn't. Society doesn't care. Maybe some day I'll be able to look on that suffering as its own reward. Not today. 
## Fantasy
I was raised with a mystical worldview—not a religious worldview, rather an accepting worldview that led me to perceive events in my life through the lens of signs, prophecies, higher purposes, and supernatural hokum. A spiritual world. A world where anything was possible and everything was beautiful and important and irreducibly complex. A world where everything happens for a reason and with a purpose. A holistic world without God.

My writing was the same. I wrote fantasy, of course. Even science fiction wasn’t romantic enough. It was too reductionistic. I was never a fan of horror. Horror wasn’t beautiful or important. Horror was the opposite of fantasy. Everything in fantasy happens for a reason. It’s all significant. Nothing in horror is significant. The protangonists live and die meaninglessly, killed by the random whim of some unearthly monster. 

I studied lots of ontological systems. I didn’t know that word until recently. I never knew what it was called. I never knew I was stuyding philosophy. I never realized this wasn’t something everybody did. Earlier this year, when I took my first philosophy class, it was a surprise that I was pretty good at philosophy. But I’d actually been studying it for a long time, without realizing it. I studied lots of religions. I found religions and their ontologies fascinating, because they were like fantasy. Each work of fantasy has its own world with its own rules. The religions were the same. Their ontologies explained the rules of the world.

I grew up. The mystical worldview never paid off. The signs never pointed me in the right direction. The beautiful and important and irreducibly complex world turned ugly and nasty, and all that complexity became a terror to live through rather than a wonder to behold. No one cared about ontology. I changed my worldview. I tried, anyway. Sometimes I still think of some event as a sign or part of a higher purpose. Unconsciously, I hear a voice in my head saying “This must be a sign.” I ignore it. I chastise myself.

But I still write fantasy. I still think ontology is interesting. I read about Christian Science. Christian Science believes that the world is spiritual and that illness is an illusion of the mind; all that’s necessary to heal illness is to use prayer and correct the habits of your mind that led you to become ill. I thought that was a fascinating way to look at it. I thought about using that in a novel.

But how much damage does it do to write fantasy? Christian Science has killed people. Not just Christian Science; other ontologies based on other medieval philosophies have killed. The people who practice them get sick and they don’t get treatment; they pray, or they drink special herb tonics, or they try a new diet, or they put crystals next to their beds. Then they get worse. Then they die.

Right in my neighborhood, there’s a yoga healer who tells everyone they can treat their sicknesses with stretching and diets. A little girl in the neighborhood has an infection in her tooth. Her parents brought her to the yoga healer. His treatment is to eat lots of leafy greens and avoid meat. Her toothache is getting worse. How long will it be before the tooth has to be pulled? How long will it be before someone realizes this treatment isn’t working?

How much damage does it do to write fantasy? If I hadn’t been raised in that mystical worldview, would I have liked fantasy? Is reading fantasy enough to make someone, especially someone young, hold a mystical worldview? Will this little girl with a toothache believe that this yoga fraud can heal her, because Madam Pomfrey can heal a toothache with a wave of her wand?

And how do I reconcile these two facets in my head? How can I be an agnostic, skeptic, critic, and yet write fantasy? So far I’ve tried to do so by writing fantasy from an agnostic, skeptical, critical point of view. So far it hasn’t worked out. It seems you really do need a mystical worldview to produce good fantasy. J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis both had one. But Philip Pullman is an atheist. Yet his work isn’t a work of atheism. The higher powers in *His Dark Materials* are malevolent rather than beneficent. But they exist. There is an alternate ontology. In some sense, even though Pullman’s work was a critical rebuttal to Lewis and Tolkien, he also fell into their trap. He used “subcreation”, which Tolkien describes as a religious act. But maybe he used it cynically. Maybe the whole book was the fantasy literature equivalent of the question “Can God make a boulder too heavy for God to lift?” Maybe that justifies it for Pullman.

So how do I reconcile these two facets? Should I reconcile these two facets? Should I give up writing fantasy and become permanently agnostic, skeptical, critical? Or should I give up that newly found and hard-won worldview, and go back to mysticism?

I don’t know if it matters what the answer is. I don’t think I can carry it out.
