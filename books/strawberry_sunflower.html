        Nora Rosen was scouted from her normal neighborhood school
        because she's a Potential&mdash;someone with the "potential"
        to have a Gift, a special, amazing ability. She's been sent to
        St. Galgani's Academy, a boarding school where Potentials and
        Gifted gather.
      </p>
      <p>
        After two months, Nora still doesn't have any friends.
        Fortunately,
        with some help from her teacher, the foxy Miss Hanover,
        Nora meets Lily van Rossum, whose Gift, the Gift of Gardening,
        lets her grow all sorts of strange plants. Nora also meets
        prickly cat girl Cora Fiorentino and sporty Amaranta "Ranta" Reyes,
        who has the Gift of Running, and the four of them join
        together to experience the sixth grade at a rather unusual school.

        I'm actively working on Strawberry Sunflower right now. The
        second book is done and just awaits its drawings, and I've
        begun writing the third book. While I never expected to be
        putting my drawings out in public, the book needed a visual
        element, and given the money I could pay, I was the only
        man for the job. The intended audience is girls ages 8-12 and
        older fans of <span class="it">moe</span> anime.

        It's sort of a fusion of anime and Western children's
        literature. My main influences were Aria, K-On, and Gakuen Alice
        among anime, and the works of Roald Dahl, JK Rowling, C.S.
        Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and of course Lewis Carroll among Western
        authors.

      <h2>Trivia</h2>
      <ul class="trivia">

            <li>Nora <span class="bold">Rose</span>n</li>
            <li>Cora <span class="bold">Fiorentino</span> (which comes
              from <span class="it">fiore</span>, the Italian word for
              "flower")</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Amaranta</span> Reyes (which
              is the Spanish name for the amaranth flower)</li>
          </ul>
          <li>

            Amaranta Reyes; Eufemia
