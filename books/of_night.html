        James Moran was a college student, floating along through a
        fourth-rate state college in a small town in Northern
        California, and spending his spare time writing a local gossip blog
        while trying to become a real reporter. One day, an
        unprecedented event happened&mdash;a sort of not completely
        ugly girl named Sophia de Nuit
        spoke to him after class. Naturally, James suspects
        she's up to no good, so when he sees her in the seedy part of
        town, dressed to the nines and going off with an old trucker,
        he follows her, and discovers that she's actually an immortal
        succubus that sustains her life and powers by draining the
        life from men with sex. James and Sophia team up to expose
        the town pastor, Joseph Austen, who's not only been molesting
        the children put under his care after school, but is actually
        an incubus&mdash;a male demon capable of turning a woman into
        a succubus.

        I have a second book finished, but I totally ran out of steam
        with this series. The first blow was the fact that my concept
        closely resembles awful Syfy Channel series <span class="it">
        Lost Girl</span>. Then I remembered that <span class="it">
        The Dresden Files</span> exists, and also discovered
        <span class="it">The Hollows</span>, and my enthusiasm for the
        series basically vanished. So it's on indefinite (but probably
        permanent) hiatus.

        The second book will come out whenever I feel like making a
        cover for it. (My artistic skills may be minimal, but I won't
        release a book unless I at least try to draw a decent cover
        for it.) When that happens, the first one will become free.
        The second book is called <span class="it">God, Country, and
        Barbecues</span>. The second chapter is up on the blog.

      <h2>Trivia</h2>
      <ul class="trivia">

          <p>
            Two of James's sisters, Sue and Lucy, are named after
            characters from <span class="it">The Chronicles of
            Narnia</span>.
            I considered naming his third sister Petra.
