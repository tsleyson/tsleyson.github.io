      This is a bunch of quotes that I like. Some of them are things
      that really struck a chord with me; others, I just thought were
      funny, or thought they had a good sound to them. There's no
      deeper message about my psyche to be found here.  Some of them
      aren't even really quotes, in that I wrote them from memory
      knowing that the exact wording was different in the source.&mdash;<em>TSL</em>

      <p>
        Sometimes people who have not had to struggle are smug and
        infuriating. This is my attempt to fight back. Theirs is a proud
        story of privilege and success. Mine is a story of
        disappointment and failure; I ought to be ashamed of it, and I
        should try to hide it. But I learned from it, and maybe you can,
        too.

        There are &ldquo;better&rdquo; languages than Perl&mdash;hell, there are
        lots of them, if you define &ldquo;better&rdquo; as &ldquo;not being insane&rdquo;.
        Lisp, Smalltalk, Python, gosh, I could probably name 20 or 30
        languages that are &ldquo;better&rdquo; than Perl, inasmuch as they don't
        look like that Sperm Whale that exploded in the streets of
        Taiwan over the summer.

            Like the &lsquo;assumptions&rsquo; of Global Climate

            revises the old unproven arguments of 1973!  In light of
            the Lies of Obamacare, how can anyone trust the words of
            revision, without supporting details and formula used for
            those revisions?
